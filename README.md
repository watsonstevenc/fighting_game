# fighting_game

This is a fighting game I made in a Python script.

Basically, we create a class of Person.

We then assign some attributes to objects of that class like health and power.

We then give the Person an Attack function.

Then we create two functions.

The first is an input that allows the user to name the fighters and set their attributes.

The second then calls the fighters and actually performs the fight.

Pretty cool, huh?
